# Why?

So you came here to have your question answered...

** Why does this bot reply to your imgur links? **

That's because you pasted an imgur album link either in your comment or your link post that has only one picture in it.

You might think: "Well hey that's not that bad right?"

**WRONG!**

On mobile this is what an album looks like:

Not only does the album obstruct most of the screen, it also takes way longer to load!

You have been informed, have a pleasant day!
