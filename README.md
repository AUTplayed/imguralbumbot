# Why?

So you came here to have your question answered...

**Why does this bot reply to your imgur links?**

That's because you pasted an imgur album link either in your comment or your link post that has only one picture in it.

Imgur changed their default upload location to be an album right away so they can put ads around it.

You might think: "Well hey that's not that bad right?"

**WRONG!**

On mobile this is what an album looks like:

Not only does the album obstruct most of the screen, it also takes way longer to load!

Without any ad blocking, a 408 Byte image uses 1.1 MB of data in an album. **That's 2827 times the original size!**

# What can I do against it?

If you want mobile reddit users to have a jolly time looking at your images/gifs then you should always post the direct link.

**But How?**

**Instructions Desktop**

(Either one works)

**Instructions Mobile App**

(Obviously select "Share Direct Link")

You have been informed, have a pleasant day!
