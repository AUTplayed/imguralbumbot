# Why?

So you came here to have your question answered...

**Why does this bot reply to your imgur links?**

That's because you pasted an imgur album link either in your comment or your link post that has only one picture in it.

You might think: "Well hey that's not that bad right?"

**WRONG!**

On mobile this is what an album looks like:

Not only does the album obstruct most of the screen, it also takes way longer to load!

# What can I do against it?

If you want mobile reddit users to have a jolly time looking at your images/gifs then you should always post the direct link.

**But How?**

**Instructions Desktop**

(Eighter one works)

**Instructions Mobile App**

(Obviously select "Share Direct Link")

You have been informed, have a pleasant day!
